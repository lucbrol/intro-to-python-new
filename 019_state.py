# Here's a mindbender for you:

a = 10
b = 20
a = b
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")

b = b + b

print(f" b is now {b}") # change valu of variable

# @TASK: What does that output? And why? Take a guess, then
# run the code and see.
#20 a which was equal to 10 is replaced by 6 which is 20

# Was it what you expected?

# Try to puzzle it out, and then move on to
# 020_state_tables.py
